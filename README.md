## Problem Statement addressed: GRAPH FOR BETTER SYSTEMS

Due to COVID-19, Public Transport Operators have had decreased ridership and revenue. With significatly lower ridership and additional cost for sanitisation of vehicles and platforms, Operators have been looking to lower their costs without impacting customer experience. We present an alternnative maintenance scheduling strategy to reduce maintance cost related to upkeep of transport vehicles. In this particular solution, we will be looking at Ferry Maintenance of BC Ferries, which run about 20 ferries over 12 routes and 8 termials. 

### Description:

However, it is not possible to adapt the frequency of transit on routes because of constantly changing restrications and policies set by the government. Hence, Operators turn towards cutting operational and maintenance cost.
